The quiz is made up of six different questions, each with four possible answers. Readers of the books will be familiar with some of the eventual answers, as these have not made their appearence in the TV-show 'Game of Thrones'. The quiz is set on one page, and features a background image of a map of the North, a kingdom in Westeros.

    # UX

## Strategy

Regarding the core UX principles I began contemplating the strategy behind this website and defined the target audience, and what features and technologies they would benefit most from. The user is quickly able to understand the information displayed on the home page, and the subsequent pages. The reasoning behind this project was straightforward, and was inspired by a renowned fitness icon amongst the YouTube community, Elliott Hulse. Through his guidance in my youth, I found the neccessary tools to use in my journey. With that in mind, I wished to create a website where I could help people of similar situations begin their journey in fitness.

### Target Audience of Strength House are:

- Everyone from the ages 15 and  upwards.
- People that find fitness to be too complicated.

### User's Reasons For Using Strength House
- Wanting to commit to a fitness routine
- Wanting to increase their confidence 
- Wanting to develop discipline through continuous hard work.

## Scope

To achieve the goal set in mind, this project will include:
- A header with a responsive navbar for desktop, tablets and phones.
- A home page introducing the reasons why one should pursue fitness.
- Different pages detailing a workout regiment.

## Structure

The reasons behind using a multi-page website was to give the user an opportunity to access the information in an organized and structured manner. The use of a hamburger navbar (tablet and phone users) is to allow the user to navigate the website with the comfort of only one hand and without over-extending the thumb (right-hand users). By ordering the pages from Push, Pull and Legs, respectively, the user is able to understand the order of which the muscle groups should be trained (left-side priority). All pages are styled with an image relevant to the muscle groups trained, deadlift for pull and squats for legs. The "About Us" page is the only page with a single section. This was done to display a clean and simple page, describing the story behind this website. Further, the footer is simple, with only an address and social media icons, This was done, as the website is a non-commercial website that is meant to be shared freely with everyone interested. 

## Skeleton

This website is structured using 5 pages; Home, Push, Pull, Legs and About Us. All menu links are spread out over different pages, so as to give the user a sense of organization.

## Surface

I chose to give this website a more elegant feel to it, as most fitness websites are rigid. This was done to give the user a feel of competency, through the effort it took to create Strength House. The color theme of this website varies depending on the page selected. The colors were used depending on the most prominent color on the hero image. For example, in the page titled Legs, the female is wearing a suit of green, as such the hover effect and columns have been made to match it, thus giving the page a structured feel.


# Features

This is a fully responsive website. Headings from h2-h6 are styled using 'Bebas Neue', whilst the h1 is styled with 'Squada One'. This is to differentiate between the hero content and the subsequent sections. 'Noto Sans' is used for paragraphs, as it is clean and elegant. The Website is comprised of five pages, provided in the navigation bar: 

## Navigation Bar

The navigation bar on the top right is used to access different pages of the website. The font is the same used for "h1". The hover effect has a distinct color, depending on which page you are on, and has a slight delay in it's width, giving each page a sense of uniqueness. When viewed on smaller devices such as tablets and phones, the navigation bar turns into a hamburger menu, to make navigating this website a lot easier.
