The quiz is made up of six different questions, each with four possible answers. Readers of the books will be familiar with some of the eventual answers, as these have not made their appearence in the TV-show 'Game of Thrones'. The quiz is set on one page, and features a background image of a map of the North, a kingdom in Westeros.
