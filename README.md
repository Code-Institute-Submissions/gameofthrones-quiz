# Game of Thrones Quiz

Welcome to Game of Thrones Quiz!

## Description

Game of Thrones quiz is a project designed to give the user a chance to test their knowledge of 'A Song of Ice and Fire' by George R.R. Martin. The quiz is made up of six different questions, each with four possible answers. Readers of the books will be familiar with some of the eventual answers, as these have not made their appearence in the TV-show 'Game of Thrones'. The quiz is set on one page, and features a background image of a map of the North, a kingdom in Westeros. You can access the site here: [Game of Thrones Quiz](https://hemenhk.github.io/gameofthrones-quiz/).

 ## Features:
* A button to begin the game
* Section for questions
* Section for answers, showing four possible answers.
* A button to get the next question.
* A button at the end of the quiz to restart it.

- The approach I had going into this project was to create a simple quiz for learning the lore of 'A Song of Ice and Fire'.
- As a part of the quiz layout, I added a score and incorrect counter so that the user would be able to know how many questions they got right or wrong. Unfortunatley, I could not get the score to work properly, hence it does not show if the answer submitted was correct or not. This will however be implemented in the future. 
The game has three distinct features, which I have taken screenshots of and posted below.

## Pages: 
There is just the one page on this website.

## Testing:
- I am able to confirm that the website is responsive on different browsers, such as Google Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer. 
- The website was tested on iPhone 12 to satisfaction.  
- The website works okay in function and in looks, with the exception of the not working score board.
